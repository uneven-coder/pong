While being a smaller project in my aim to learn TypeScript React, I’ve actually learnt more. Every problem I had in my other, more complex projects I’ve also had in this one. Being smaller, it let me focus on it, letting me try out different fixes without lots of refactoring, and I’ve retained more. I will take what I’ve learnt and use it to structure future, complex projects better.
